      "and his team for the vision set out in the Speech from the Throne. It sends a \n",
      "clear message, and all Canadians will see that the government had them in mind \n",
      "when preparing its agenda.</p>\n",
      "<p>Honourable senators, the Governor General called on us to work together with \n",
      "a renewed spirit of innovation, openness and collaboration. He then outlined \n",
      "five main objectives, which I would now like to elaborate on.</p>\n",
      "<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>\n",
      "<p>First, a clear priority was the growth of the middle class, an optimistic and \n",
      "practical vision that will be achieved by carefully crafting lower taxes for the \n",
      "middle class, strengthening the employment insurance system, enhancing pension \n",
      "plans and working with the provinces to develop a health accord. The objective \n",
      "is grand, but it is encouraging to see the specific steps outlined that will \n",
      "make achieving this possible.</p>\n",
      "<p>It is essential that among these steps, the federal government works with the \n",
      "provinces to support Canada's youth from low- and middle-income families. We \n",
      "need to make post-secondary education more affordable for those who are willing \n",
      "to work hard to pursue it. What is more, we need to have an economy that is \n",
      "ready to receive these young people so they can pay down their debt right away \n",
      "and begin contributing to our economy.</p>\n",
      "<p>According to Statistics Canada's 2014 survey,<i> Graduating in Canada: \n",
      "Profile, Labour Market Outcomes and Student Debt of the Class of 2009-2010</i>, \n",
      "43 per cent of college graduates owe close to $15,000 by the end of their \n",

      "<p>These young people are smart, energetic and eager to contribute, but too many \n",
      "of them carry a tremendous debt from pursuing their studies even before they \n",
      "have started working. To strengthen our country, we need to invest in the \n",
      "education of our youth and remind them that they should be willing to as well. \n",
      "This must be a strong priority for us going forward.</p>\n",
      "<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>\n",
      "<p>Second, the government is committed to open and transparent government.</p>\n",
      "<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>\n",
      "<p>Parliament will work with greater transparency and openness by introducing \n",
      "electoral reform and by giving MPs more power. Part of this will also affect our \n",
      "very own chamber. We know that the appointments of senators will be reformed, \n",
      "stressing a non-partisan approach.</p>\n",
      "<p>Honourable senators, for me it is a privilege to work alongside the members \n",
      "of this chamber, and it has been encouraging to see us all work hard to improve \n",
      "and evolve. I would like to thank Senators Massicotte and Greene for their \n",
      "efforts in starting the conversation on how we modernize our institution. I \n",
      "would also like to thank Senators Housakos, Mitchell, Cordy, Wells and Batters \n",
      "for introducing effective ways to communicate about the work we do as senators.</p>\n",
      "<p>Honourable senators, I would be remiss if I did not thank our leadership of \n",
      "Senators Cowan, Fraser, Munson, Carignan, Martin and Marshall for all the work \n",
      "they have done in the last session and continue to do on our behalf.</p>\n",
      "<p>Our ultimate goal as senators is to better represent the Canadian national \n",
      "interest and the rights of minorities and to ensure those views are protected in \n",
      "our legislative process. I welcome any additional measures that will strengthen \n",
      "our resolve in pursuing this goal.</p>\n",
      "<p>I have faith we will work in a non-partisan manner together as Canadians have \n",
      "demanded of us. As my leader Senator Cowan has stated, we have to fix this from \n",
      "within, and I agree.</p>\n",
      "<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>\n",
      "<p>Third, the government will prove to Canadians and to the world that a clean \n",
      "environment and a strong economy go hand in hand. We cannot have one without the \n",
      "other. The Governor General stated that protecting the environment and growing \n",
      "the economy are not incompatible goals. In fact, our future success demands that \n",
      "we do both.</p>\n",
      "<p>I agree with the government, but I must point out that our concern for the \n",
      "environment and the economy must not overshadow our obligation to protect human \n",
      "rights. How we choose to promote economic growth and tackle climate change will \n",
      "have a direct impact on the rights of all populations.</p>\n",
      "<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>\n",
      "<p>Typically, discussions around climate change revolve around the economy, \n",
      "environment and science. These are all necessary conversations, but more and \n",
      "more information from these spheres demands that we question: How will all of \n",
      "this affect us as human beings?</p>\n",
      "<p>The United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights found \n",
      "multiple links between climate change and how its effects stand to violate human \n",
      "rights, particularly by those already living in poverty.</p>\n",
      "<p>According to the UN, climate change stands to directly violate the rights of \n",
      "many in Canada and abroad. The right to food, water, health, adequate housing, \n",
      "life and self-determination are all at threat. If Canada truly wants to be a \n",
      "leader in mitigating the effects of climate change, we must find ways to \n",
      "comprehensively tackle these issues in addition to the economic and \n",
      "environmental challenges.</p>\n",
      "<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>\n",
      "<p>Fourth, the government's agenda reflects that Canada's strength is its \n",
      "diversity. The Governor General of Canada said, and I quote:</p>\n",
      "<p>Canadians elected a government to bring us together, not to set us \n",
      "\tagainst one another. Canada is strong because of our differences, not in \n",
      "\tspite of them.</p>\n",
      "<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>\n",
      "<p>There is no doubt that we are in a great country and live together as equals. \n",
      "Canada is a place where diversity flourishes, and we see strength in our \n",
      "differences. We know diversity and adversity can be catalysts for greatness, and \n",
      "in Canada we proudly provide the foundation people need to create a better \n",
      "future for themselves and, in turn, create a better Canada.</p>\n",
      "<p>In line with our legacy of acceptance and diversity, I am eager to see the \n",
      "25,000 Syrian refugees be resettled here by the end of February 2016.</p>\n",
      "<p>Honourable senators, I have often visited the refugee camps in Jordan, Turkey \n",
      "and Lebanon, and I have spoken with those affected by the war in Syria. As \n",
      "someone who has seen the pain in many camps, I'm very grateful that we will \n",
      "create a haven for people who have lost everything.</p>\n",
      "<p>Honourable senators, fighting on the front lines can take different forms. We \n",
      "get to choose what battles we fight. The people of Syria are tired of bombs, no \n",
      "matter who they are coming from. What they want is peace. What they want is to \n",
      "go home.</p>\n",
      "<p>When I was in Cila at the border of Turkey and Syria, I spoke to a little \n",
      "girl. She was 12 years old. Her home had been barrel bombed, and she had lost \n",
      "her limbs because of it. She was sitting in a makeshift wheelchair and had \n",
      "propped a book on her wheelchair while her sister turned pages for her.</p>\n",
      "<p>Her request to me was simple. She said, \"Please help us stop the bombing. \n",
      "Tell Canadians to help us finish our studies. I want to grow up and be a \n",
      "teacher. I want to go home to Syria.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Humanitarian aid is necessary. The refugee crisis is real, and we need to \n",
      "give people hope. We need to give humanity an opportunity for a better future, \n",
      "but ultimately, we need to foster peace in the region. We need to foster peace \n",
      "in Syria. This, too, must be a key goal of our government. We can and must play \n",
      "a key role in facilitating a formal peace process. We, as a country, know how to \n",
      "build peace processes. We are known for our expertise.</p>\n",
      "<p>Honourable senators, I work with women in Lebanon in an organization called \n",
      "Mobaderoon. They are working with groups to see how they can bring peace amongst \n",
      "themselves. What these women have said to me is, \"You could take 25,000, you \n",
      "could take 50,000, you could take 75,000, you could take 100,000, but we do not \n",
      "want to go outside Syria. We want you to help us bring peace to Syria.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Further, the protection of our diversity, as the Governor General noted, \n",
      "requires protection of our languages.</p>\n",
      "<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>\n",
      "<p>In addition, the government will encourage the use of Canada's official \n",
      "languages, and for that I am thankful. French and English are very important in \n",
      "this country. In my province, British Columbia, parents really want their \n",
      "children to be able to learn French. There aren't enough classes. When my \n",
      "grandson wanted to learn French at school, there was no space for him in a \n",
      "class. His mother tried to register him at 11 different schools. The school year \n",
      "began and there was still no room for my grandson. His name was placed on many \n",
      "waiting lists. Two months after the beginning of classes, he was finally \n",
      "accepted.</p>\n",
      "<p>I believe that in our bilingual country, all children should learn and speak \n",
      "both official languages. That is our heritage. We must not deny our children the \n",
      "right to speak our official languages. The government must invest in this.</p>\n",
      "<p>I also call on the government to allocate resources to help immigrants and \n",
      "refugees who come from francophone countries and live outside Quebec learn \n",

      "one has to be partisan.</p>\n",
      "<p>Now, let me share with you what I consider the word \"partisan\" to mean, \n",
      "because I think there's quite a bit of confusion over three words — \n",
      "partisanship, politics and policy.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Partisan\" I looked up a few months ago when there was a debate of similar \n",
      "character, and it struck me — I think it was the Oxford English Dictionary, the \n",
      "OED, that said partisanship is blind obedience, blind obedience to a party line. \n",
      "That's a three-line whip, as we would say in the vernacular: blind obedience to \n",
      "a party line.</p>\n",
      "<p>Now, that strikes me as being something that actually eats away at the \n",
      "effectiveness of a chamber — a legislative body — when it is considering \n",
      "measures that come before it in a legislative manner. So I strongly urge \n",
      "senators to consider moving beyond a straitjacket in which we consider that we \n",
      "must be, and continue to be, locked into a blind obedience to a party line.</p>\n",
      "<p>Politics is another question that is sometimes considered to be less than \n",
      "worthy. Being a former cabinet minister, of course I disagree with that. I think \n",
      "politics is a fine and wonderful public service. But, again, I think it needs to \n",
      "be played out and a contribution to civil society in an honourable manner.</p>\n",
      "<p>That is not to say that you defeat your enemies. It is to say that you have \n",
      "an open debate. You bring different ideas to the chamber. You have differences \n",
      "of opinion. You work them out in peaceful ways. You find ways to settle the \n",
      "differences of opinion, usually by voting on them, and you walk out of the \n",
      "chamber afterwards as colleagues. Perhaps with differences of opinions, but \n",
      "colleagues.</p>\n",
      "<p>So politics isn't the problem. Of course, \"policy\" is a broader term \n",
      "altogether. It is choosing a policy, a set of rules, to follow for society. \n",
      "That's really what we are ultimately reaching for in all that we do: setting up \n",
      "a society, a civil society, that reflects our pluralistic nation and all of the \n",
      "advantages that we, as Canadians, take pride in. This is why we're opening up \n",

      "legislative. They are investigative. We also do diplomacy and advocacy. We do \n",

      "discrepancy in the arguments of Senators McCoy and Cools, Joyal and Fraser.</p>\n",
      "<p>Senator Cools, I listened to you on many occasions in this very chamber, \n",
      "getting up and making a very strong argument that it was essential on the part \n",
      "of the government to have not only a representative in here but you used the \n",
      "term \"minister of the Crown\" and that it was abhorrent that any government would \n",
      "show such blatant disrespect for this institution. You made those eloquent and \n",
      "great debates sitting in that chair right next to me when I was Speaker. I \n",
      "listened very attentively. So I agree with you. I think we need to have a \n",
      "minister or, at bare minimum, a representative or, at bare minimum, a bridge \n",
      "between this institution and the other. That's how the Westminster model works.</p>\n",
      "<p>Senator McCoy says that she has not totally bought into the idea that there \n",
      "are only two sides to the Westminster parliamentary system, that there are other \n",
      "political parties and, indeed, there are. There's room in this great political \n",
      "system for all voices. Parliamentarians, on the House of Commons or on the \n",
      "Senate side, despite their political affiliations, can get up at any point in \n",
      "time and stand on principle. It has happened on many occasions, on both sides of \n",
      "this chamber.</p>\n",
      "<p>So no one is compelled to vote with their political philosophy or ideology or \n",
      "party all the time if they have a principled stand to take, but we cannot forget \n",
      "that in every single legislature in the Commonwealth there's a government that \n",
      "represents the Crown and there's Her Majesty's Official Opposition. That's what \n",
      "you have in the House of Commons. That's what you have in the Senate, and you \n",
      "have a third party and a fourth party and independents with no recognized status \n",
      "other than the fact that they are respectively recognized.</p>\n",
      "<p>Senator Fraser points to the House of Lords as an example, and I think it is \n",
      "an example. I think it's the basis upon which our democracy in Canada functions. \n",
      "There is a government leader in the House of Lords, and there always has been \n",
      "one. If I'm not mistaken, even currently there are ministers sitting in the \n",
      "House of Lords on behalf of the government, and it doesn't impede them to have a \n",
      "number of party affiliations and a large number of independents. I think that \n",
      "has proved in the United Kingdom, as it can be proven here, to be a very great \n",
      "contributor to political discourse.</p>\n",
      "<p>Senator Fraser and Senator Joyal pointed out that there is evolution and \n",
      "change coming. I'm all for change, but change has to be done within the confines \n",
      "of the Constitution, and it has to be done in consultation with this \n",
      "institution, not unilaterally where we're being dictated to by a government \n",
      "leader on the House of Commons side through radio interviews, rather than \n",
      "through speaking to the leadership on what we need to do with our rules.</p>\n",
      "<p>Senator Joyal and Senator Fraser quite appropriately pointed out in their \n",
      "discourse that on one hand we don't need a government leader here to function, \n",
      "and we don't need to hold the government to account. On the other hand, you said \n",
      "there are other means to do it, and one of those means is to bring ministers \n",
      "before the Senate and question them. Either you agree that we need to have some \n",
      "form of keeping accountability on the other side or that we don't.</p>\n",
      "<p>If I understand my colleagues correctly — and I agree with Senator Fraser and \n",
      "Senator Joyal because they certainly did an eloquent job, through the years I \n",
      "sat on the government side, of keeping our government in check — this \n",
      "institution has that role to play as well. It's in the rules. Both of you know, \n",
      "honourable colleagues, that we don't have the power to compel ministers or \n",
      "members of the House of Commons to come before this house. We can invite them, \n",
      "but we can't compel them.</p>\n",

      "points out that this is a place for debate, and I agree. Again, debate can only \n",
      "take place and be rooted where it all begins. In Canada, in our political \n",
      "system, political debate and policy debate starts within political parties. It \n",
      "could be the Liberal party, the Conservative party or the NDP. I haven't seen \n",
      "many issues come on the floor of the House of Commons or the Senate of Canada, \n",
      "or any provincial legislature in this country, where the issues did not ignite, \n",
      "come forward or fester out of a political policy conference somewhere and a \n",
      "political party.</p>\n",
      "<p>With all due respect to independents, I have never seen an independent \n",
      "movement bring a political issue to the national arena and take it forward and \n",
      "create a vigorous debate on the issue. All of those debates stem from some \n",
      "political party, some political philosophy or some political ideology.</p>\n",
      "<p>All the independents that are sitting in this house today all espouse some \n",
      "political principles. That's how they got here. For whatever reason they chose \n",
      "that they felt more inclined to operate independently, and we respect that \n",
      "because that's what a democratic Parliament does.</p>\n",
      "<p>As parliamentarians we can't forget that parliaments in our British system \n",
      "speak for the people — the body that is elected and even this appointed body, \n",
      "which has a particular role to represent minorities and regional interests in \n",
      "this country. We speak for our stakeholders, and all those stakeholders combined \n",
      "make up the shareholders of the country.</p>\n",
      "<p>If we are taking away that principle as parliamentarians to be able to \n",
      "articulate vigorously and debate those issues, honourable senators, while \n",
      "there's somebody sitting in this chamber that will take that message back, \n",
      "whatever the outcome, to the executive branch, then those three essential \n",
      "elements of our Parliament, which is the Crown, the Senate and the house, \n",
      "completely fall apart.</p>\n",
      "<p>That's why I focused on two areas, namely government accountability — which \n",
      "the Senate has a role in playing — and, of course, we have a role as senators \n",
      "here in that vigorous progress and debate to add value to the government's \n",
      "barometer. That's what the government is. The executive is supposed to listen to \n",
      "its people. If it's not listening to the legislative chambers, to whom are they \n",
      "listening when they're advancing their policy? How are they engaging with the \n",
      "public if they are not respecting Parliament?</p>\n",
      "<p>I want to terminate by saying that Parliament speaks for the people; the \n",

      "<p>Can we expect this federal government to fulfill its obligations under the \n",

      "<p>Many were relieved to see a link with the federal government's Action Plan \n",

      "language communities across the country. However, the new emphasis on creating \n",
      "partnerships with the provinces in the areas of health, education and culture, \n",

      "the commissioner, Justice Murray Sinclair, announced that the commission \n",
      "supported an inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women and girls, the \n",
      "room erupted in applause, great emotion and tears of joy that that was going to \n",
      "happen. I'm pleased to note that that process is proceeding and that the \n",
      "minister announced the first phase yesterday.</p>\n",
      "<p>I'm first going to talk about First Nation education, because of course we \n",
      "know that in order to advance in Canadian society, or any society in the world, \n",
      "having a good education is one of the best things you can do to escape from the \n",
      "cycle of poverty. It's not the only thing, it's not the magic bullet, but it's \n",
      "certainly something that helps enormously along with other things. That \n",
      "commitment to education is extremely important.</p>\n",
      "<p>As honourable senators know, I've been a senator for the last 10 years. \n",
      "During Question Period I asked numerous questions of our esteemed colleague \n",
      "Senator Carignan about First Nations education and unequal funding, and for many \n",
      "years that unequal funding was denied. Now it has been acknowledged by the new \n",
      "government that there is unequal funding and that the 2 per cent cap that we \n",
      "complained about for many years will be removed.</p>\n",
      "<p>With respect to unequal education funding, across Canada on average \n",
      "on-reserve education funding is $7,000 per pupil, whereas the provincial average \n",
      "is $10,000. There's a gap of about $3,000 per child across the country. That's \n",
      "from kindergarten to Grade 12.</p>\n",
      "<p>In my home province of Saskatchewan on-reserve students, each pupil will \n",
      "receive $6,400 for their education, whereas the provincial rate is $10,500. So \n",
      "that's a gap of $4,100. That gap will be closed.</p>\n",
      "<p>Of course, unless we have equal funding you cannot have the same quality of \n",
      "teachers and you cannot have the same resources. That will go a long way to \n",
      "improving high school graduation, along with changes to the curriculum to \n",
      "include the history of indigenous peoples and the language.</p>\n",
      "<p>I also want to mention that we in the Senate have contributed to these \n",
      "findings. In December 2011, the Standing Senate Committee on Aboriginal Peoples \n",
      "released our Senate report on First Nations education. Our second recommendation \n",
      "dealt with this issue of funding.</p>\n",
      "<p>To quote from our report, we said:</p>\n",
      "<p>. . . we believe that a new funding formula, negotiated by the parties \n",
      "\tand based on real cost drivers, must be developed to replace the current \n",
      "\tsystem of contribution agreements.</p>\n",
      "<p>Then we had Recommendation 2, which basically stated that we should provide \n",
      "statutory authority funding to the minister to make payments for education; we \n",
      "should ensure that the payments are enshrined in regulations, authorized under a \n",
      "new education act and developed in consultation with First Nations; that the \n",
      "regulations would consider key cost drivers, such as demographics and \n",
      "remoteness; and that the formula for establishing payments include, among other \n",
      "things, language preservation and revitalization programs.</p>\n",
      "<p>Now, I read this into the record because it isn't sufficient to say we're \n",
      "going to remove the 2 per cent cap. It's more complicated than that. I hope that \n",
      "the government will take into account our report. It was an excellent report. As \n",
      "a committee I think we developed this report in probably the most non-partisan \n",
      "manner possible. That recommendation on funding is a very strong one and should \n",
      "not be forgotten by the new government — it's more than removing the 2 per cent \n",
      "cap.</p>\n",
      "<p>I'd like to turn your attention to the missing and murdered indigenous women \n",
      "and the inquiry. Since June of this year I have given four major speeches about \n",
      "missing and murdered indigenous women and girls in my province of Saskatchewan. \n",
      "Most of the time I focused my remarks on the RCMP reports, the first of which \n",
      "came out in May 2014 and confirmed what the Native Women's Association of Canada \n",
      "and Amnesty International said in 2004. They confirmed that we have a problem: \n",
      "Indigenous women and girls go missing and are murdered in much higher numbers \n",
      "than they should.</p>\n",
      "<p>The RCMP essentially confirmed that and said that there are about 1,200 \n",
      "missing and murdered indigenous women and girls across Canada and that \n",
      "indigenous women and girls are three times more likely to go missing and four \n",
      "times more likely to be murdered. Unfortunately, the RCMP report and the media, \n",
      "and the previous minister, made a mistake in focusing on family violence only. \n",
      "They focused on family violence as being the key cause for the murders and \n",
      "kidnapping and what have you of these indigenous women.</p>\n",
      "<p>Over the summer I went through the RCMP's statistics to show where they had \n",
      "gone wrong, and there were three big mistakes that the RCMP made. The problem \n",
      "with that was those mistakes informed the government action plan. So the action \n",
      "plan was based on a false or flawed interpretation of the RCMP report.</p>\n",
      "<p>First, what the RCMP did in terms of big mistakes, they noted that the number \n",
      "of homicides for non-Aboriginal women had dropped, but for Aboriginal women it \n",
      "had remained steady over 30 some odd years. They noted that, but they didn't see \n",
      "the significance. If the rate of homicides of non-Aboriginal women is dropping, \n",
      "then you have to question why there is a difference. Clearly what we're doing \n",
      "now is not helping Aboriginal women, because the number of homicides has not \n",
      "dropped. So they basically ignored that finding.</p>\n",
      "<p>Second, they didn't assign much importance to their own data, which showed \n",
      "that Aboriginal women are more likely to be murdered by an acquaintance than are \n",
      "non-Aboriginal women. Following on that, if you're a non-Aboriginal woman it's \n",
      "more likely that your spouse will be the person who will kill you. Family \n",
      "violence was actually greater in the non-Aboriginal population, but somehow that \n",
      "was left by the wayside. Nobody was interested in that. So prevention efforts \n",
      "should be focused on acquaintances of Aboriginal women, and that's not what the \n",
      "previous government's action plan was doing.</p>\n",
      "<p>Finally, their third mistake — I'm repeating it again — is they focused on \n",
      "family violence on reserves. We all know that the majority of Canada's \n",
      "Aboriginal people do not live on reserves anymore; the majority live off \n",
      "reserve. We now know that family violence isn't the main factor.</p>\n",
      "<p>(1440)</p>\n",
      "<p>There were flaws in the interpretation of that report that informed the \n",
      "government action plan. Consequently, there will need to be changes to that \n",
      "government action plan.</p>\n",
      "<p>Fortunately, in the last month or two, the media has caught on to these \n",
      "mistakes, and now we're getting headlines such as in<i> The Toronto Star </i>— I \n",

      "<p>This is not true.</p>\n",
      "<p>It's acquaintances, it's strangers and it's serial killers that account for \n",
      "nearly half of the murders. It isn't only family violence.</p>\n",
      "<p>These are very important things to take into consideration. That's one of the \n",

      "<p>Similarly,<i> The Globe and Mail</i>, within the last few weeks, also had a \n",
      "number of articles talking about serial killers. The serial killers are not \n",

      "<p>I am extremely happy that the Liberal government is now proceeding with a \n",

      "more money to raise their kids but also hopefully will contribute to poverty \n",
      "reduction; the government estimates it will lift some 315,000 Canadian children \n",
      "out of poverty, as they promised to do during the election campaign.</p>\n",
      "<p>Honourable senators, the government has also committed to work with the \n",

      "Committee on Social Affairs, Science and Technology did the statutory review of \n",
      "the health accord in 2012. Many of the recommendations in the report called<i> \n",
      "Time for Transformative Change</i>, which was unanimously passed by the \n",
      "committee and this chamber, will find their way into the discussion the new \n",
      "Minister of Health will be leading in terms of attempting to provide for a new \n",
      "health accord with the provinces going forward.</p>\n",

      "the provinces — will result in a better health care system for all.</p>\n",
      "<p>Finally, I want to talk about the commitments with respect to the Senate that \n",
      "were made both in the Speech from the Throne and previously by the Prime \n",
      "Minister in his former role as Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada. They are \n",
      "good moves. I think they will lead to a less partisan, more independent chamber. \n",
      "It isn't going to be easy getting from here to there, but the appointment of a \n",

      "exercise in the appointment of senators that will allow for some vetting of \n",

      "<p>As honourable senators know, the Speech from the Throne is an opportunity for \n",

      "embarks on a new session. While I have some concerns with the priorities \n",
      "outlined by this government in the Throne Speech, I have very serious concerns \n",
      "with what was not included.</p>\n",
      "<p>Quite frankly, I find it shocking that there was no mention of the largest \n",

      "the speech, which leaves me with great concern. At a time when the rest of the \n",
      "world is expanding and enhancing their fight against the Islamic State, Canada \n",
      "is pulling back. The speech even made a veiled suggestion that cuts would be \n",
      "made by stating they would invest in a \"leaner\" military.</p>\n",
      "<p>The Liberals were so critical of the Conservatives for fear-mongering, the \n",
      "Defence Minister even stating days before the Paris attacks that Canadians need \n",
      "not fear ISIS. We do not have to fear ISIS, he says. I wonder whether our \n",
      "friends in France and San Bernardino would agree with the minister that we have \n",
      "no fear.</p>\n",
      "<p>Further, I wonder whether these attacks will qualify as evidence for the \n",
      "Liberal government's evidence-based policies on Syria, CF-18s and the overall \n",
      "ISIS strategy.</p>\n",
      "<p>Prime Minister Trudeau asserted that Harper's insistence that we must \n",
      "increase our military action against the Islamic State was a dismal distraction \n",
      "from his economic record. Well, as it turns out, Stephen Harper was absolutely \n",
      "correct with his comments. ISIS has named Canada and Canadians specifically as \n",
      "targets, and we need to act accordingly. We have the ability to contribute with \n",
      "humanitarian aid as well as with military force. It would be irresponsible for \n",
      "our own national security and the security of those we are seeking to help in \n",
      "war-torn regions to weaken our efforts.</p>\n",
      "<p>(1500)</p>\n",
      "<p>To focus solely on humanitarian assistance without a strong military \n",
      "presence, to quote representatives from diaspora groups in Canada, we would \n",
      "simply be \"dropping aid on dead people.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>After the Paris attacks, an Ipsos-Reid poll found that the majority of \n",
      "Canadians want us to continue air strikes against the Islamic State, which \n",
      "demonstrates that Canadians are now seeing that the Liberal Party was wrong in \n",
      "their approach. The responsible thing for the government to do at this point \n",
      "would be to respect the will of Canadians on the issue of air strikes and combat \n",
      "and simply admit that they were wrong — something they should be getting quite \n",
      "used to by now.</p>\n",
      "<p>The government needs to be cognizant of the best interests of Syrian people, \n",
      "most of who, in fact, desperately want to return to their country yet will not \n",
      "be able to do so safely without strong, measured military action.</p>\n",
      "<p>I am grateful, however, that the Liberals have at least admitted that they \n",
      "were wrong and have in part adjusted their Syrian refugee plan and self-imposed \n",
      "deadline to accommodate for security concerns that were outlined by both the NDP \n",
      "and Conservative parties during the election. However, they continue to throw \n",
      "out numbers with unrealistic and unreasonable self-imposed deadlines, which is \n",
      "troubling. We need to make sure that the security of Canadians remains \n",
      "paramount.</p>\n",
      "<p>Colleagues, the Speech from the Throne, not surprisingly, mentioned growth of \n",
      "the middle class, as this was indeed a pillar of the Liberal campaign. However, \n",
      "we are quickly finding out that the impact of the Liberals' proposed economic \n",
      "policies will not benefit the middle class, but rather will cost Canadian \n",
      "families. In the Liberals' plan, the biggest tax cut goes to people earning \n",
      "between $89,000 and $200,000. If those incomes do not sound middle class to you, \n",
      "that is because statistically they are not.</p>\n",
      "<p>Furthermore, if the Liberals are seeking to lower the tax burden on the \n",
      "middle class, they are acting in complete contradiction by cutting the Tax-Free \n",
      "Savings Account limit back to $5,500. The Liberals asserted that this somehow \n",
      "unfairly benefited the wealthy. Not only are 80 per cent of all Tax-Free Savings \n",
      "Account holders earning less than $80,000 a year, but the Liberal plan to roll \n",
      "these limits back from $10,000 to $5,500 completely cancels out any benefit \n",
      "their so-called tax break would afford the middle class.</p>\n",
      "<p>As Catherine Swift of the Working Canadians group asked in a news release \n",
      "earlier this week:</p>\n",
      "<p>This government claims to be concerned that average Canadians are not \n",
      "\tsaving enough for their retirement, and then weakens one of the key means \n",
      "\tfor Canadians to save in a tax-efficient way?</p>\n",
      "<p>Colleagues, we are now also finding out that the projected $3 billion in \n",
      "revenue that the tax hike on the rich was supposed to generate in order to \n",
      "offset the middle class tax cut was in fact grossly inaccurate. In fact, the \n",
      "total revenue from the tax cut will be less than $1 billion, keeping Canadian \n",
      "taxpayers on the hook for the other $3 billion. Perhaps the Prime Minister \n",
      "should have gotten out the calculator that he told CTV's Steve Murphy that he \n",
      "had no interest in using.</p>\n",
      "<p>Although now, we are seeing clearly that, like Pierre Elliott Trudeau, our \n",
      "new Prime Minister does not view election promises as binding.</p>\n",
      "<p>With respect to the Liberals' $10 million deficit, expectations are being \n",
      "managed downward. The Liberal election platform reads explicitly on page 76 that \n",
      "the Liberal government will have a deficit of less than $10 billion in each of \n",
      "the next two years. Now Prime Minister Trudeau has downgraded this to a \"sincere \n",
      "hope.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>The Speech from the Throne was indicative of exactly what many of us \n",
      "expected: a government that values big government and big spending to the \n",
      "detriment of Canadian taxpayers.</p>\n",
      "<p>Another major concern of mine is the proposed serious changes to our \n",
      "electoral system without a referendum. They are committing to do away with the \n",
      "first-past-the-post system by the next federal election, simply stating that \n",
      "they will engage in a consultation process. This would be a fundamental change \n",
      "to our democratic process, and it is imperative that Canadians consent. And, no, \n",
      "39 per cent of Canadians supporting this government does not equal consent.</p>\n",
      "<p>When Justin Trudeau says he wants to take this to Canadians, let him take \n",
      "this to Canadians in the form of a referendum. I imagine that his hesitation has \n",
      "something to do with the fact that every provincial government has opened this \n",
      "issue to the public. Even after gaining their trust as government, they have not \n",
      "received approval to abandon the first-past-the-post system. They will either \n",
      "decide on a proportional representation system, which will leave us with a \n",
      "future of unstable minority governments, or they will choose the option many of \n",
      "us are suspecting, the preferential ballot system, which unfairly benefits the \n",
      "Liberal Party as the self-asserted centrist option.</p>\n",
      "<p>It is a bit ironic that the Liberals were so opposed to our Fair Elections \n",
      "Act, which did nothing but modernize and strengthen the integrity of the \n",
      "electoral process, and after they claimed that they were somehow tilting the \n",
      "odds in our favour, were still able to pull off a majority. Now they are \n",
      "proposing self-serving, fundamental changes to our system that so clearly \n",
      "benefit the Liberal Party above all other political parties in our Parliament.</p>\n",
      "<p>Éric Grenier, an analyst for CBC, concluded that the Liberals' proposed \n",
      "preferential ballot system would only benefit the Liberal Party and would in \n",
      "fact have resulted in more Liberal seats in the past election. This blatant \n",
      "manipulation of the system and moving forward without explicit support of the \n",
      "Canadian public is an affront to democracy.</p>\n",
      "<p>Colleagues, the Speech from the Throne did not mention the manufacturing \n",
      "sector. It did not mention the energy sector. What is particularly offensive to \n",
      "me as a western Canadian senator — and I have to disagree just slightly with my \n",
      "colleague Senator Mockler when he said that it did not mention agriculture at \n",
      "all. In fact, the only thing in the agricultural sector that it mentioned was in \n",
      "regard to the legalization of marijuana. Not grain farming —</p>\n",

      "determination to engage all levels of government in addressing its call for \n",
      "inclusion and improved coordinated services.</p>\n",
      "<p>On April 2, 2014, only a year and a half ago, the alliance, in partnership — \n",

      "launched a National Needs Assessment Survey to gather input from almost 6,000 \n",
      "respondents, parents and service providers.</p>\n",
      "<p>Think of this: We are getting all our statistics from the Centers for Disease \n",
      "Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia about our country, and we are now \n",

      "<p>In preparing my presentation to you, I debated about whether to begin with \n",
      "the good news or the bad. You have now heard the good news. I have provided \n",
      "examples of building blocks and progress in our country's ability to deal \n",
      "effectively with autism. However, in communities where each of you live, there \n",
      "are still families weighed down and incapacitated by the demands of dealing with \n",
      "autism. Waiting times for early diagnosis can be years. Because of this, many \n",
      "young children cannot access intervention treatments early enough to realize \n",
      "optimal benefits.</p>\n",
      "<p>To avoid waiting and missing out on necessary treatment, parents are paying \n",
      "out of their own pockets for services unavailable through the public health \n",
      "system. Autism is a significant health issue and people need to pay for basic \n",
      "assessment and treatment. By the way, it is also a human rights issue in my \n",
      "view.</p>\n",
      "<p>Once children with autism turn 18, they lose their pediatricians, they lose \n",
      "their eligibility for public funding of speech and language services and \n",
      "behavioural therapy. At 21, they can no longer attend public school. Only a \n",
      "lucky few live in group homes and attend day programs or even have part-time \n",
      "jobs. And of course, honourable senators, it is not only the children with \n",
      "autism who are getting older, but the parents who care for them are, too, which \n",

      "<p>Honourable senators, if you have talked with parents with autistic children \n",
      "you most certainly have been touched by their stories. In each there is always a \n",
      "common fear: What will happen to my child when I can no longer carry the load? \n",
      "That's the question. It is a thought that haunts each and every parent of a \n",
      "child with autism. And their concern is legitimate. Care and housing options for \n",
      "autistic adults in this country are meagre.</p>\n",
      "<p>Two years ago, I met with a group of parents in Woodstock, New Brunswick, who \n",
      "were raising their autistic children without the benefit of even knowing what \n",
      "public resources they were eligible for and how to access them. Meanwhile, the \n",

      "from the homes where they struggled in isolation and without support or \n",
      "guidance.</p>\n",
      "<p>On a stormy night in Walton, Ontario, near Lake Huron, only a year ago, I met \n",
      "with another group of parents. One of them was a mother who spoke tearfully \n",
      "about her experiences raising her autistic son, who was prone to violence. She \n",
      "described how her only defence against being physically hurt by him — and you \n",
      "have to remember she's being loved by him six days a week — was that she could \n",
      "still outrun him. It is 2015, and she has to run from her own son down an \n",
      "isolated country road in the middle of the night.</p>\n",
      "<p>What people with autism need most is what we all need and want most: the \n",
      "opportunity to learn, to acquire life skills and to become as independent as \n",
      "possible. Where there is a lack of opportunity to support transitions, gaps must \n",
      "be filled and changes introduced. Inclusion has to be an explicit social and \n",
      "policy priority. Ignoring the necessity for and failing to create these vital \n",
      "opportunities is a human rights travesty.</p>\n",
      "<p>Honourable senators, after all these years I still wonder when the federal \n",

      "those two things properly and effectively in the context of knowing that if we \n",

      "stimulate a 21st century economy perhaps unlike anything in a positive way that \n",
      "we've been able to imagine.</p>\n",
      "<p>I have said it before and will say it again: We restructured our economy to \n",

      "the most successful western industrialized economies in the western world and \n",
      "has sustained an unprecedented level of quality of life for most Canadians for \n",
      "upwards of 70 years. Dealing with the environment properly, dealing with climate \n",

      "about establishing targets. I would really congratulate the Minister of \n",
      "Environment for the fact that she has established the 1.5 per cent as a working \n",
      "target. There are those who say the target is too tight and the targets are too \n",

      "an interesting seminar I attended with my wife Teresa on a trip to Goldsmiths \n",

      "around ourselves we actually inspire greater creativity than if we just open \n",
      "everything up. It's the pressures of having to overcome certain obstacles and \n",

      "Governor General, to our government that I think are important for this \n",
      "government to keep in mind.</p>\n",
      "<p>First of all, it does have a political mandate to do something about climate \n",
      "change. The Prime Minister brought together the premiers to work together — \n",
      "imagine that — to confront that challenge. So the mandate exists, but what we \n",
      "need to be certain about is that there is the political will, the political \n",
      "credit, amongst the population of Canada to allow that to happen because we know \n",
      "that the best of political intentions can certainly be thwarted and stymied by a \n",
      "democratic public that isn't inclined to agree with what the government wants to \n",
      "do or how it wants to do it.</p>\n",
      "<p>I think there is general agreement, clearly stated by the electorate: 70 per \n",
      "cent voted against a government that wouldn't even talk about climate change; 70 \n",
      "per cent voted for parties that are determined to do something about climate \n",
      "change. I think there is a mandate.</p>\n",
      "<p>How do we sustain the will? How do we build the credit? How do we build the \n",
      "consensus amongst Canadians so that that mandate can be fulfilled effectively? I \n",
      "believe it comes down to consultation with the public. There are new \n",
      "methodologies. There is a great deal of research, a great deal of practice now \n",
      "with new consultative methodologies. They come under the category of \n",
      "deliberative democracy, and they do two things. They allow governments or other \n",
      "organizations to solicit the public, to solicit experts as well — stakeholders — \n",
      "to get ideas. But they also, in the same process, allow the building of \n",
      "consensus amongst those stakeholders, the public and other organizations, which \n",
      "allows action to be taken and to be taken effectively.</p>\n",
      "<p>It's a given. We are going to deal with carbon, and it's pretty clear that \n",
      "we're going to have a carbon price one way or another, in some cases with a \n",
      "carbon tax and, in other provinces, with cap and trade. Either way, there is \n",
      "going to be a carbon price in this country. It's also clear that the government \n",
      "is committed to funding renewable energy, funding conservation, funding green \n",
      "projects for the future, green infrastructure. But the question is, once we've \n",
      "accepted that these things are on the agenda — and they are — how do we get the \n",
      "best ideas from the public and from stakeholders so that we know we're doing \n",
      "them in the best possible way? If we consult properly, if we use modern \n",
      "technologies and other techniques that allow for that input, we also create a \n",
      "national debate, perhaps a passionate national debate, about that. We can bring \n",
      "people together, and we can set direction and build consensus around ideas about \n",
      "the way to do that most effectively. That's the first thing that I say to the \n",
      "government, that we need to structure a public debate across this country, based \n",
      "on consultative techniques. There are very modern, effective technologies, \n",
      "techniques and methodologies for doing that, and I would push them and encourage \n",
      "the government to undertake those.</p>\n",
      "<p>Second, a feature of confronting a new energy future is new technologies. \n",
      "There is a very interesting model in Calgary, based in southern Alberta, called \n",
      "TECTERRA. I don't know whether Senator Tannas is aware of it, but he might well \n",
      "be. Perhaps Senator Black and others from Alberta would be. TECTERRA is a group \n",
      "of business people and high-tech academics who got together voluntarily and \n",
      "said, \"What is one area where Alberta has advanced in technological development, \n",
      "for example?\" They came across one, among many others. It was geospatial \n",

      "sure that when you're tunneling 32 metres under the ground for a sewage tunnel, \n",
      "you don't have to keep adjusting to make sure you're going straight. There are \n",
      "many success stories now in Alberta with that kind of advanced technology. So \n",
      "they said, \"Okay, we have some kind of advantage there. We have advancement \n",
      "there. We have a base in academia and a base in business. We have a tech sector \n",
      "that has already embraced that particular area — geospatial technology. What can \n",
      "we do to facilitate that? Rather than have government pick winners and losers, \n",
      "what if we set up a group, called TECTERRA, of business people, scientists, \n",
      "academics, people who are high-tech specialists in this area, who could take \n",
      "grant money from the Alberta government in this case and from the federal \n",
      "government and decide where to put that and make judgments, on a business basis, \n",
      "on where to put that, rather than having government doing that directly? So they \n",
      "set up this remarkable group and a remarkable process that operates like a \n",
      "business, is non-profit, screens their applications extremely carefully with \n",
      "expertise and ensures that the way that they contribute the money to the \n",
      "business meets two criteria: one, it has to go to a project that the business \n",
      "wouldn't otherwise do but has the expertise in and interest in doing — so it's \n",
      "new; it's breakthrough — and two, it has to be structured in a way that doesn't \n",
      "limit that business's ability to go to the capital markets to get more money. \n",
      "It's very carefully done and very smartly done, and what's happened is that they \n",
      "have had a tremendous amount of success.</p>\n",
      "<p>Over the five years that they have existed, they have put out about $35 \n",
      "million. They have had $139 million of actual economic impact, with new \n",
      "projects, new technologies, developments and companies in Alberta, and $157 \n",
      "million in Canada. They think that the projects that are now in place will have \n",
      "a $300 million impact by 2018. Two hundred and forty-three new jobs have been \n",
      "created and supported in Alberta, and 303 have been created in Canada. Two \n",
      "hundred and eighty-three professionals are engaged in technological development \n",
      "and commercialization as a result of these projects, almost 400 in Canada. Also, \n",
      "121 small and medium-sized enterprises — that's the area that they focus on — \n",
      "have been supported, 182 in Canada. I could go on, but the point that I want to \n",
      "make is that it has been extremely successful in the way that it has developed \n",
      "technologies, inspired business and not been a waste of money. All the projects \n",
      "don't necessarily work out. But most have worked out, and they have returned \n",
      "development and income and jobs well beyond the money that has been invested and \n",
      "would have otherwise been invested in different ways by governments. That's a \n",
      "model that could be used more broadly for green technology and renewable \n",
      "energies, not just for geospatial technology, and it's something that I \n",
      "encourage the government to consider.</p>\n",
      "<p>Underlining both of my points about the improvement of the environment really \n",
      "is the fact that the environment and dealing with climate change will be \n",
      "essential to the economy and my idea for generating effective investment in \n",
      "green technologies and renewable energies and technologies of the future.</p>\n",
      "<p>Underlining both of those things is another point that is made in this Throne \n",
      "Speech that I want to emphasize. That point is the emphasis that the government \n",
      "is placing on supporting young Canadians and their effort to get post-secondary \n",
      "education, to make that post-secondary education more affordable. Any of us who \n",

      "transportation and settlement. But then the local community or a local \n",

      "that the number of refugees coming to Canada is now 10,000 until the end of \n",
      "December and then another 15,000 to the end of February. So the program will \n",

      "<p>As I mentioned earlier, even the privately sponsored refugees have a lot of \n",

      "to 20 departments involved here. For the 25,000 refugees that will be coming to \n",
      "Canada before the end of February, $70 million to $80 million will be needed for \n",
      "transportation and health care alone, irrespective of whether they are privately \n",

      "<p>In terms of Treasury Board, some of you asked questions about the \n",

      "was very good, but they stated that this is a fluid, moving project because of \n",
      "the size of the project. If we go back to one of the last major refugee crises \n",
      "from Southeast Asia, in around 1978, that was the last time we had the scope of \n",

      "<p>So I suggest, colleagues, that we really have nothing to lose and everything \n",
      "to gain by trying something like this. Judging from the public comments of \n",
      "Minister LeBlanc, I think he expressed on behalf of the government a willingness \n",

      "one of the consequences of the system we have is that we don't always have an \n",

      "acknowledge, perhaps, is a better way to put it — that the opposition is also \n",
      "underrepresented in major urban centres across the country.</p>\n",
      "<p>It seems to me that adds a burden to those in the Senate who represent those \n",

      "here who were able to raise the concerns of that province in this chamber in a \n",

      "<p>I wanted to remind honourable senators that this supply bill, which calls for \n",

      "As we said yesterday, that's only the Citizenship and Immigration side of \n",

      "their first year.</p>\n",
      "<p>Finally, there is Treasury Board supplementing or topping up the $750 million \n",
      "that they hold in reserve to use in times when Parliament is not sitting but \n",
      "money is needed on a very short-term basis. But it must be according to the very \n",
      "tight rules that our Finance Committee and this Senate Chamber participated in \n",

      "be used. It must be for established programs. The government can't come along \n",
      "and say, \"We thought of something new; we need some money for this.\" That has to \n",

      "diligent and disciplined government management sends a message to the public \n",
      "service and the bureaucracy that deficits are tolerated and accepted. They are \n",
      "even desirable and the stuff of election promises. The message to the \n",
      "bureaucracy suggests that we can spend however much we want.</p>\n",
      "<p>Deficits therefore don't really matter, since the Liberals can make an \n",
      "election promise to run one. Letting our guard down like this will result in \n",
      "increased spending in the public service and will have an impact on the size of \n",
      "the deficit.</p>\n",
      "<p>Furthermore, this issue has been raised before. For example, C. Scott Clark \n",
      "wrote an opinion piece about it in the<i> Globe and Mail</i>. Mr. Clark is a \n",
